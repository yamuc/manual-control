Find way to print to in-game console

Button turn-off script does not work
 - doesn't seem to see anything in the activated buttons list
 - finding a way to print to the in-game console would speed this up quite a bit

Creation of the relative window on the button to set the "hold amount"

Change passthroughs to a combinatorPrototype with decider graphics/settings on it
 - will probably need to make a custom ui
